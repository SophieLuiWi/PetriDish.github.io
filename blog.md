"Book delivery to a microcosmos" is a short story taking place in a minature world where viruses are books and cells are tiny cities buzzing with life centered around a majestic library. 

"Fishing for a whitefly's gut" is a story in two parts: part one (posted here) dives into the technical intricacy of dissecting a little whitefly to get to its gut (which requires an eyelash glued to a pipet tip ;)). Part two is still work in progress and will cover the looming question why anyone would possibly do that.
