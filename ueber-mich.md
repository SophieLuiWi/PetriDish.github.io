    description: (2023) After several years spent in the lab, in front of microscopes and at conferences to share my work and get inspired, I finished my PhD at the end of 2022. By mere serendipity, I studied human viruses for my PhD and ended up taking images of one of the most deadly viruses - Ebola virus - and the most well-known virus at the present time, SARS-CoV2. Drawn as an undergraduate student to the abstract (and often dry) world of structure biology, this work has profoundly shaped my fascination with cell biolody and microbiology..
    
    description2: (2021) I’m a PhD student in molecular biology and I study viruses to a large extent by looking at them through different microscopes. Never would I have thought I’d be a researcher one day (let alone do a PhD) and I bet no one at high school would have imagined me with a white lab coat and pipette or in front of multiple computer screens operating a 300 kV microscope. I have not been fascinated by science since I was a kid; I haven’t played with chemistry toolkits to build molecules from rubber sticks and balls; and I haven’t joined any science club or math competition. When I discovered my fascination for science rather impulsively during my final year in high school, my dad (a passionate researcher himself) put my persistence to the test and taught me to fish for a whitefly’s gut with an eyelash glued to a pipet tip. It took me many hours to get the hang of it and when I did, pipetting – the bread and butter for a biologist – didn’t seem that difficult anymore. These few weeks in the lab and the discussions starting with the first coffee in the morning and ending with the last sip of wine at night, made me realize science is about imagination and creativity and patience as much as it is about being versed in math, biology, chemistry and physics. Ten years later I am still enjoying microscopy (albeit a different kind) and the more I learn and discover, the more I start imagining this beautiful, mesmerizing universe we are composed of and surrounded by and yet cannot see.
