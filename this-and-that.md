#### Cartoons

What is a petri dish really if you look at it closely? A round, plastic vessel, 10 cm in diameter? A sterile container that cells like to grow in if you provide them with a little bit of nutritious liquid? Or could it house a deep ocean, where coverslips and microscopy grids float around like little boats? Cells could be sunbathing on coverslips, idly observing cheerful viruses jumping into the ocean to take a swim.

And when nobody's watching and the lights are turned off, imagine how pretty they would look if they fluoresced...
