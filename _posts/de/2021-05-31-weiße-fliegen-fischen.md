Before entering my dad’s lab, I don’t think I have ever seen a silverleaf whitefly. To my untrained eyes, they resembled tiny fruit flies buzzing around the green leaves of agricultural crops like overripe bananas on the kitchen table. But still, they looked like very pale fruit flies and I had no clue I was looking at one of the most devastating agricultural pests in the world. It was the summer before I started studying biochemistry and I was about to hold my first pipet to do some simple experiments as a preparation for the years to come. My dad – wary of my newly found interest in biochemistry and lab work – generously offered to give me a glimpse of a researcher’s life and teach me some wet lab basics. He had walked me through his labs and we had just been to the green house when he showed me one of the light microscopes. “Let’s see if you can fish for a bemisia’s gut.” We were standing in a small room leading to the green house, in front of a desk with a lamp illuminating a tabletop microscope. I had heard him talk about ‘bemisia’ before and knew he meant the flies. I was fairly certain he was indeed referring to a fly’s intestine. But did he really want me to take out the gut from a whitefly? How would I even catch a whitefly, let alone “fish” for its gut? And what would I do with the gut on the hook? But first and foremost: *why on Earth* would anyone fish for a whitefly’s gut?

I quickly learned that the silverleaf whitefly, *Bemisia tabaci*, thrives in warm temperatures and predominantly pesters plants in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. It feeds on sweet, juicy plant sap and females lay their eggs right beside their feeding ground on the underside of a plant leaf. Though not traveling far, a single female can lay up to 400 eggs and a rapidly growing swarm can cover entire fields of plants deemed delicious by the not-so-picky flying pest. On their quest for food, they move from plant to plant and transmit diseases that can destroy an entire crop, while doing no harm to the flies themselves. Their sheer number, resilience, ability to feed on a wide range of different plants and capacity to carry more than a hundred different plant pathogens makes the silverleaf whitefly a highly important research target. And apparently, the doom they spread between plants sometimes also travels through their gut.

Among the pathogens that travel with the flies and account for their infamous reputation, are viruses that are picked up unnoticed at every meal. They swim in the sap of a sick plant, get sucked up along with the sugary juice and are released during the next meal into the veins of another plant. These viruses cause a number of different disease phenotypes and are conveniently named accordingly (Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, Cucumber vein yellowing virus, Cassava brown streak virus,…). The relationship between a whitefly and a virus that is transmitted from plant to plant is intricate and complicated. How does the virus travel through the insect? While not causing any harm? Where does it stay inside the fly between different meals?   
To address these questions – and uncountable more – any institute researching plants and their pests maintains greenhouses that mimic the warm and humid environment ideal for both plants and disease-causing insects. Tall, transparent sliding doors and walls separating each room reveal a beautiful composition of different plants, reminiscent of a botanical garden. To protect healthy plants, the sick ones are kept in special boxes, or miniature greenhouses: sealed Plexiglas cages with sleeves attached that can be used to work without opening a lid or door. While I was interning in my dad’s lab, about to isolate a tiny gut from an already pretty tiny fly, I used a cage that contained cassava plants. Delicate stems, narrow green leaves arranged like a hand fan and underneath the soil roots that can tell a lot about the plants’ health[^1]. 

The plants’ leaves were covered with little whiteflies that went about their busy daily routines. To collect them, I was taught how to use a blue plastic tip (like a small funnel) that was sealed on the bigger opening with a fine mesh. When placing it between the lips and sucking air from that end, the flies can be trapped inside the tip, against the mesh. That means I voluntarily sucked in air to pull flies *inside my mouth*[^2]; readily accepting the human-vacuum-cleaner-feeling that tickled my throat like storm flies when biking with an open mouth. But nothing can pass the mesh and this technique proved to be quite effective as I had quickly gathered enough flies for my first dissection attempts. The hypothesis my dad’s lab was investigating: the viruses that are taken up by the bemisias do not stay in the flies’ mouths but travel all the way through their digestive system. Proving that meant to dissect the flies…and find the virus. 
With the flies trapped in the plastic tip, I went to the microscope to start fishing for their gut (a quick warning: the following description is purely methodical and sounds horrendous; I could not think of a better way). My dad showed me how to numb the flies with some drops of chloroform and place one after the other in a drop of water on a microscopy dish. Looking through the binocular, I then took two thin needles (one in either hand) to carefully pin down the flies and separate head from torso. This part was surprisingly easy, while the next took me hours (!) to get right. When pressing gently on the decapitated head, the kidney-shaped, sturdy salivary glands appeared, while pressing just below the belly released the circular intestine into the drop of water. The first circular guts I saw swimming freely around excited me so much, I had to hold my breath to not accidentally smush them with my needles. Collecting them wasn’t too easy either: to avoid rupturing them, we would not use a needle, but an eyelash kindly donated by another colleague in the lab (blessed with thick, curled eyelashes). 
<br />
When glued to a pipet tip, the eyelash had the perfect shape and elasticity to serve as fishing rod and hook. Off it went into the water drop, and out again with the gut dangling from its tip. Then a careful transfer into an eppendorf tube and voilá: that’s how to fish for a whitefly’s gut!

<br />
..So why would anyone do this again?
