blurb: "brief history of yeast"

<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>

Besides lab mice and Drosophila (common fruit flies), baker’s yeast is one of the most popular model organisms used by researchers around the world. Long before they were used to study the function of different proteins or genes and the architecture of cells, yeasts have become invaluable to mankind as the essence of bread and beer. Their discovery is intricately linked to the production and refinement of both and dates back more than 200 years ago (while they were unknowingly used for centuries!).

*“The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.”*
Matthew 13.33/ Luke 13.20-21 (some time during the 1st century C.E.)

Contrary to many scientific terms and protein names, which are of Greek or Latin origin, the word “yeast” is of Proto-Germanic origin (jest, German Gischt, Old English gist) and describes the foam or froth produced in any sugary solution containing yeast. In fact, the word “yeast” and variations thereof were used for decades before two teams in France and Germany discovered simultaneously in the early 1800s that the foam is produced by living organisms and not by starchy particles of grain (Leeuwenhoek, 1680) or accumulated albuminoids (Fabroni, 1799); and even long after fermentation was understood to astonishing chemical detail (Levoisier, 1789). In search for the earliest scientific description of yeasts, I came across the almost literary observations by Thomas Huxley in 1872, who starts his review elegantly titled Yeast(1) by describing “little bubbles [which] will be seen rising to the surface, and their abundance [which] will increase until the liquid hisses as if it were simmering on the fire.” In the context of bread-baking and sourdough starters, one can almost smell the sourness while imagining the hissing. When enough liquid is used, exceeding the amount required for sourdoughs  “…some of the solid particles which produce the turbidity of the liquid [will] collect at its surface into a scum, which is blown up by the emerging air-bubbles into a thick, foamy froth. Another moiety sinks to the bottom, and accumulates as a muddy sediment [..]. When this action has continued for a certain time, with more or less violence, it gradually moderates.” Another observation made by anyone who has dipped their toe into the field of brewing, has set a foot in any yeast lab or has accidentally left a fruit juice for a considerable amount of time unsupervised outside of a fridge. Unaware of the biochemical processes that are causing these “yeasty waves”(1) and, in fact, centuries away from discovering the true nature of the microorganism, scientists were transfixed on characterizing the origin of the hissing sound and bubbles – the ”fixed air” that is the bi-product of fermentation.
