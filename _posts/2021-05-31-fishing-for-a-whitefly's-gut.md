Whiteflies are the plant's mosquitos - they are a nuisance, spread severe diseases and are difficult to get rid off.


##### FOOTNOTES

[^1]: In a time when science was communicated largely in German, Kausche, Pfankuch and Ruska published their [first images](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01493353.pdf) of Tobacco Mosaic Virus, which have become more [detailed](https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.15252/embr.201948451) with the development of better microscopes ;-)

[^2]: If you look closely, you will see differences between them: Some copy only short chapters, others are working only occasionally and copy the entire book at once.
