If the siutation ever arose: how would you "fish" for a whitefly's gut? And if successful, what would you do with the gut on the hook? Most importantly (though the toughest to discuss and probably impossible to get to the bottom of): why would you fish for a whitefly's gut? 

When I contemplated studying biochemistry to understand the nature of things (or whatever romantic idea I had those days), I spent a few weeks in my dad's lab to learn basic experiments and get a noseful of what I was getting into. One of the tasks I was facing was to collect a handful of specimen of the silverleaf whitefly, or Bemisia tabaci, a nasty little insect that looks like a white relative of a fruit fly and besieges a vast number of different, unfortunate tropical plants.
