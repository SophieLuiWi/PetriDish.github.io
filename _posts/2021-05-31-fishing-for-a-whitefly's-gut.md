Work in progress ;)

If the situation ever arose: how would you "fish" for a whitefly's gut? What would you do with the gut on the hook? But first and foremost: *why* would you fish for a whitefly's gut?

When I contemplated studying biochemistry to understand the nature of things (or whatever romantic idea I had those days), I spent a few weeks in my dad's lab to learn some basic experiments and get a noseful of what I was getting into. One of my tasks was to collect a handful of specimens of the silverleaf whitefly, a nasty little insect that looks like a white relative of the fruitfly and besieges a vast number of different, unfortunate tropical plants. 

The silverleaf whitefly feeds on sweet, juicy plant sap and lays her eggs right beside her feeding ground on the underside of a plant leaf. Though not traveling far, a single female can lay up to 400 eggs and a rapidly growing crowd of whiteflies can cover entire fields of plants deemed delicious by the not-so-picky flying “pest”. Traveling with the flies (and largely responsible for their infamous reputation) are all sorts of stowaways that are picked up unnoticed at every meal. Viruses swimming in the sap of a sick plant get sucked up along with the sugary juice and are released during the next meal into the veins of another plant. Where do they hide in between the meals? Are they holding on to the probiscis of the fly? Do they get swallowed and regurgitated? Why don’t they sicken the flies?     

To mimic the warm and humid environment ideal for both plants and flies, any institute researching plants and their pests maintain greenhouses. Tall, transparent sliding doors and walls separating each room reveal a beautiful composition of different plants reminiscent of a botanical garden. To understand how viruses are transmitted, some of the sick plants are kept in special boxes: sealed plexiglas cages with sleeves attached that can be used to work without opening the box. The box I was using contained cassava plants. Delicate stems, narrow green leaves arranged like a hand fan and underneath the soil roots that can tell a lot about the plant’s health[^1]. The plants’ leaves were covered with little whiteflies that went about their busy daily routines. To collect them, I had a blue plastic tip (like a small funnel) that was sealed on the bigger opening with a fine mesh. When placing it between the lips and sucking air from that end, the little flies can be trapped against the mesh. It gives a weird human-vacuum-cleaner-feeling and though nothing can pass the mesh, for the following hour my throat felt like after swallowing a storm fly when biking with an open mouth. 
With the flies trapped in the plastic tip, I went on to start fishing for their gut. I was taught how to numb the flies with some drops of chloroform and place one after the other in a drop of water on a microscopy dish. Looking through the binocular, I then took two thin needles (one in either hand) to carefully pin down the flies and separate head from torso. When pressing gently on the decapitated head, the kidney-shaped, surprisingly sturdy salivary glands appeared, while pressing just below the belly released the circular intestine into the drop of water. To collect the gut without rupturing it, another colleague in the lab (blessed with thick, curled eyelashes) had donated an eyelash and glued it to a pipet tip to serve as the fishing rod and hook. And despite this sounding rather cruel (even for the treatment of a fly): that’s how to fish for a whitefly’s gut! So why would anyone do this again?
