Work in progress ;)

If the situation ever arose: how would you "fish" for a whitefly's gut? What would you do with the gut on the hook? But first and foremost: *why* would you fish for a whitefly's gut?

When I contemplated studying biochemistry to understand the nature of things (or whatever romantic idea I had those days), I spent a few weeks in my dad's lab to learn some basic experiments and get a noseful of what I was getting into. One of my tasks was to collect a handful of specimens of the silverleaf whitefly, a nasty little insect that looks like a white relative of the fruitfly and besieges a vast number of different, unfortunate tropical plants. 

The silverleaf whitefly feeds on sweet, juicy plant sap and lays her eggs right beside her feeding ground on the underside of a plant leaf. Though not traveling far, a single female can lay up to one hundred eggs and a rapidly growing crowd of whiteflies can cover entire fields of plants deemed delicious by the not-so-picky flying “pest” . Traveling with the flies (and largely responsible for their infamous reputation) are all sorts of stowaways that are picked up unnoticed at every meal. 
To mimic the warm and humid environment ideal for both plants and flies, any institute researching plants and their pests maintain greenhouses. Tall, transparent sliding doors and walls separating each room reveal a beautiful composition of different plants reminiscent of a botanical garden. Some plants  



Whiteflies are the plant's mosquitos - they are a nuisance, spread severe diseases and are difficult to get rid off.
