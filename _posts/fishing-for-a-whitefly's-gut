#### Preface (or virus infection in a nutshell)
<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>
Viruses are tiny. They are the smallest pathogens that infect and often devastate living organisms from the smallest (bacteria) to the largest, including us. An infection starts with the entry of a single virus into a cell. Once inside, the virus takes control of the host cell machinery to multiply and generate many copies of itself. The newly formed viruses then find their way out of the cell again, spread to surrounding cells and repeat their infection cycle until they are defeated by the defense mechanisms of the infected organism – or until their host succumbs. 
<br />
A single human cell is so small, it is invisible to the naked eye but can be magnified with simple microscopes that have been around for more than 300 years. A virus, being even smaller than a cell, is so tiny that it requires special microscopes to reveal its shape and size and the first image of a virus wasn’t acquired until 1935[^1]. Since then, viruses have been studied with tools and instruments unimaginable just a few generations ago. New species are discovered all around the world, revealing ancient relationships between different viruses and their hosts. And the remarkable details unveiled about the “life” cycle of some viruses create infinite room for imagination.
<br />

#### If cells were cities...

A human cell is like a city buzzing with life, a tiny microcosmos in a bubble. The largest area right at the center is taken up by the most important building, the library: a tall, round building, which dwarfs every other of the city’s structures. It harbours 46 volumes of a single encyclopedia, each of them so thick, they are surrounded by stools and ladders for people to climb on and turn the pages. One can see people passing from one end of the library to the other, moving ladders, opening books, passing around paperweights to keep the pages open. Austere-looking librarians wearing round glasses are waiting at the many entrances to let people in and point them in the correct direction. There are old-fashioned clerks[^2]  with pen and paper sitting in front of opened books, meticulously copying letter after letter, line after line of seemingly infinite text until they abruptly stop, pack their stacks of neatly written paper into bulky briefcases and pass them to skinny errand boys. With the briefcases in their hands, the errand boys rush past the librarians and swarm out of the stuffy library and into the city.

<br />

Outside the library, life is just as busy. The errand boys don’t have to keep looking long until they find workers strolling around in search for work. They hand over the briefcases and the workers immediately sit down to study the paper stacks. Because what the clerks have been copying so tirelessly in the library are instruction manuals for all sorts of marvelous machines for each task needed for everyday city life. In fact, the encyclopedia in the library contains nothing else but instruction manuals for machines and buildings and tools of all shapes and complexities. There are pumps to generate energy, transporters, wrapping stations for the post, sorting and alarm systems and metal detectors. They all must be built, maintained, repaired and when broken beyond repair, taken to the next recycling station to be taken apart. Once the workers have gone over their instruction manual, they start gathering material to build their respective machine. Most of the city is a huge construction site: One can see wheelbarrows of sand and carts full of bricks being moved around, half-built houses next to impressive architecture. Road workers are rapidly paving unfinished streets on which impatient truckdrivers are already waiting in their trucks with running motors to deliver their cargo. Work in the city progresses at an astonishing speed, with millions of machines being built, replaced, repaired and torn down all the time. Day in and day out, the city is on her feet, restless and thriving. Until one day, out of the blue, an unexpected parcel arrives.

#### ...and viruses a special delivery

Far away from the city, still unaware of any future events, a striking parcel lies on the ground. Apparent only from the numerous stickers it is studded with, it resembles more an accessory than packaging: a colourful pouch, smoothly adapting the shape of what appears to be an elongated box. Beautifully ornamented, the box is composed of many small pieces, like an assembled mosaic. Taken apart, one by one, it reveals a delicate papyrus roll held together by leather strings. The papyrus roll is so wide, it stretches all along the length of the box and it is covered with an endless sequence of letters, uninterrupted by punctuation or empty space. Finally, stuck to one end of the papyrus roll is a magnifying glass. It has a varnished handle and is attached with a string to the umbilicus, the wooden stick used to unfurl the scroll. 
All by itself, the parcel can lie around for a long time undiscovered and undisturbed. Yet, from time to time, somebody passes by: a street cleaner, equipped with his sturdy broom and dustbin; two kids running on the street, playing soccer with an old can of coke; a woman pushing a stroller while scolding her older child about running on the street. Most are too preoccupied to notice the parcel on the ground. Until one day somebody does take notice, picks the parcel up from the ground and - unable to make sense of the address scribbled on the many stickers on the pouch - brings it conscientiously to the nearest city.

#### Delivery to a microcosmos

At the city borders, the parcel is received by a transport vehicle from the import and export services to be brought to the city center, which extends radially all around the library. The truck driver jumps out of the truck cab, goes to the rear end of his truck, and opens the tall doors to pass the parcel to the next clerk he can find strolling over the square towards the library. Promptly, the pretty packaging attracts a rapidly growing number of curious clerks who immediately set out to take the parcel apart: they don’t waste time marveling at the softness of the pouch or the beauty of the box. They only have eyes for the papyrus roll and immediately start pulling at the leather strings to open the scroll and decipher what it says. But when the clerks start reading, they don’t recognize the uninterrupted pattern of letters in front of them. They turn the paper around and upside-down and send out to call other transcribers from the library for help. But the code does not reveal itself until one of the clerks finally finds the magnifying glass attached to the umbilicus. He moves it slowly over the letters and discovers that instead of magnifying the letters, the glass changes them to familiar patterns he can understand. Excited about this discovery, the clerks quickly copy the new pattern on as many empty pieces of paper as they carry on them. They distribute them among themselves to simultaneously start decoding its meaning. To their delight the code on the papyrus roll is an instruction manual with seven chapters, each one for a different part of the parcel itself. Chapter one, two, five and six are all about the leather strings keeping the papyrus roll together. Chapter three contains instructions for building the wooden box and chapter four describes the production and processing of the stickers studding the surface of the malleable pouch. Though not saying much, these stickers label the final parcel as the parcel it is and make sure it gets sent and delivered to the next city. Once produced, the workers must transport the stickers to the customs office to be stamped and approved, before delivering them to the city borders, waiting for the remaining parcels. The last chapter is the longest and, in some respects, the most important one as it describes how to create the secret to read the papyrus roll in the first place: the magnifying glass. Fascinated by the strange papyrus roll and the frenzy it creates, more and more clerks drop everything they were doing and rush out of the library to the others to form efficient working groups- some duplicate the text, others copy it into readable code. As soon as the first copies of the translations are done, workers join the scene and snap the copies out of their hands. The instructions are so intricate and fascinatingly foreign, like the clerks the workers forget everything they had worked on before and set out to follow the instructions. Some workers organize carpenters to carve pieces of wood and assemble it together into the three-dimensional mosaic-like puzzle, which constitutes the wooden box. Others are tailors, skillful with different cloths and material and grab the chapters about the leather strings. Yet others find the instruction for the sticker in chapter four and at once get to work. The glassblowers are far ahead, following the instructions in chapter seven, expertly reproducing the magnifying glass. And so, slowly at first but with increasing speed, most citizens drop their original work in order to re-build all parts of the parcel, in great numbers. They wrap the newly made leather strings around the copies of papyrus roll produced by the clerks and place them into the boxes still smelling of cut wood. They proudly attach one magnifying glass per scroll to the umbilicus and place it on top of the papyrus roll. Then the boxes are closed, piled up and loaded onto trucks already waiting in line to drive to the periphery of the city, where the stickers are ready to be picked up. At the city border, the boxes get unloaded one by one and each is placed into a soft sticker-decorated pouch. Finally, they are sent off to the neighbouring cities.

Looking back at the city, the face of it has completely changed. No buzzing life anymore, no sounds, but ruins and abandoned constructions sites. Like a city after an invasion of foreign troops, workers and clerks are left around standing forlornly with the creased papyrus rolls still in their hands- there is no new papyrus left to write on, no wood to carve, no leather or glass. And everyone is hungry, because in the craze of reproducing the beautifully covered scroll, food and sleep have been forgotten. 
<br />

#### The aftermath

Turning away from the city center and leaving the library and the square full of scattered people behind, the citiy borders come into view. The traffic has almost come to a standstill and the once well protected border is now abandoned. Beyond the borders lies a universe of neighbouring cities, very similar to this one as it used to be. Most of them have received their parcel already and are met with the same fate. Some lonely ones must have heard from the misery and have been warned not to look directly at the box, for its beauty mesmerizes everyone who lays eyes on it. They are fighting against their own, against curious clerks and workers who dare to look and are prepared to snatch the instruction manuals away at all cost. Yet, among the sea of dying cities, there are some resistant islands that have closed their borders and are standing their ground confidently.  

#### Final notes

This is what I imagine a virus would be if it were a little bit more like an everyday object, we are more familiar with. Since, simply speaking, viruses are very well protected genomes, the book analogy often used to describe DNA came immediately to my mind. Similarly, the cell can be described as a city buzzing with life and almost any biochemical process can be described with an analogy of the inner workings of a city. 
<br />
One discrepancy, however, that arises when these two analogies are mixed is the difference in dimensions. A virus (like the Ebola virus used in this example) of approximately 2 µm in length is magnified 300,000 times to become a papyrus roll of 60 cm length. A human body cell of 30 µm on the other hand, is magnified approximately 22 million times to become the smallest city in the world (the Vatican, which has an area of only 0.44 km^2). 
<br />

And last but not least: I am very grateful for the invaluable input I received from Dimitris, Helen, Theresa, Nic and Michi (in the order they received the different drafts ;-)). Thanks a lot for your time and patience and critical input regarding “biological correctness”.
Special thanks to my crazy sister, for whom I wrote this story in the first place and who has made me laugh so many times with her spot-on detection of logical errors.
