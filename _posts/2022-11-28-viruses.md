### Prologue
By chance, viruses became the subject of my doctoral thesis in 2018. Fascinated at the time by biophysical techniques, I joined a lab that was using state-of-the-art microscopy techniques to study viruses and how they interact with host cells. Since I was new to the field of virology, I started reading about the very basics of what viruses are, when and how they were discovered and how they have been intertwined with all forms of life. This has been one of the most captivating periods of learning for me and I spent hours going through the literature of the last century to recreate the excitement of the beginnings of virology. The following is part of the introduction of my doctoral thesis â€“ covering the discovery of viruses in general, and Ebola virus (the focus of my research) in particular.
